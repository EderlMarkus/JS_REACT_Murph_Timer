# JS_REACT_Murph_Timer

THIS IS NOT A PRODUCTION-QUALITY-STANDARD, this is just a little Web-App I made for my own convenience. 

I'm well aware, that the structure of the React-Code is far from perfect, also that there is an insufficient documentation.

The Reason this Repository is not private is to give some of my friends and colleagues a chance to use the Timer for their Training as well. 

You find another readme in the folder "murph-timer"
